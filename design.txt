1. Title: Flatmates Bill

2. Description: An _app_ that gets as input the _amount_ of a _bill_ for a particular period and the days
that each of the flatmates stayed in the house for that period and returns how much each flatmate
has to pay. It also generates a pdf reprot stating the names of the flatmates, the period, and how much
each of them had to pay.

3. Objects:
How to find objects? Look at the description. Each noun should be an object (= class) :)

Bill:
    amount
    period

Flatmate:
    days_in_house

___
example for that
class Bill:
    def __init__(self, amount): # bill w/o amount doesn't make sense
    self.amount = amount

bill = Bill(20)
print(bill.amount)
